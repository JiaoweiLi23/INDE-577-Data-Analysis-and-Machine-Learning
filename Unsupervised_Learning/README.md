# Unsupervised Learning 

## Overview
This folder contains implementations of two key unsupervised learning algorithms applied to various real datasets. The algorithms include K-Means and Principal Component Analysis. Each algorithm is demonstrated on a dataset that showcases its strengths and typical use cases.

## Contents

1. **K-Means**
   - **Algorithm**: K-Means Classifier
   - **Dataset**: 'palmer_penguins' dataset on kaggle
   - **Description**: Implementation of a K-Means classifier, suitable for categorical data classification.

2. **Principal Component Analysis**
   - **Algorithm**: Principal Component Analysis
   - **Dataset**: 'framingham' dataset on kaggle
   - **Description**: Implementation of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a statistical technique used in data science to reduce the dimensionality of data while retaining the most significant variance.
