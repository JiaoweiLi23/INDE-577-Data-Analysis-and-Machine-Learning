# Single Neuron Logistic Regression
Single neuron logistic regression is a fundamental machine learning technique used for binary classification problems. It operates by applying the logistic function to a linear combination of input features, thereby transforming the output into a probability between 0 and 1. This model is particularly useful for cases where the decision boundary between two classes is linear and is often used as a building block in more complex neural network architectures.
