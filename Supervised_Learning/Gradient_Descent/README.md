# Gradient Descent

Radient Descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize a function by iteratively moving towards the minimum value of the function. It is commonly used in machine learning to find the best parameters for a model. The algorithm updates the parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient of the objective function with respect to the parameters. In this file, I will build the Gradient Descent algorithm from scratch and implement it on a real world data set.
