# Perceptron
The perceptron is an early type of artificial neural network, invented in 1957 by Frank Rosenblatt, designed to perform binary classifications by processing multiple input signals. It operates by weighing its inputs, summing them up, and passing them through a non-linear function to produce a binary output. Despite its simplicity and limitations in handling complex, non-linear problems, the perceptron laid the groundwork for the development of more advanced neural networks in machine learning.
