# Perceptron 

## Introduction
This Jupyter notebook delves into the foundational concept of the Perceptron, an early form of artificial neural networks, developed by Frank Rosenblatt in 1957. The notebook covers its theory, implementation, and application in a binary classification task.

## Contents
1. **Introduction to Perceptron**
   - Overview of the Perceptron and its historical significance.
   - The basic working principle of the Perceptron model.
2. **Perceptron Algorithm Implementation**
   - Implementation of the Perceptron algorithm from scratch.
   - Detailed explanation of the code and algorithmic steps.
3. **Data Application**
   - Application of the Perceptron model on a real dataset.
   - Visualization of the decision boundary and error convergence.
4. **Limitation of Perceptron**
   - Discussion on the limitations of the Perceptron model.
   - How these limitations led to further advancements in neural networks.

## Implementation
The notebook demonstrates the practical implementation of the Perceptron algorithm using a dataset from Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER. Key aspects include:
- A custom implementation of the Perceptron model in Python.
- Applying the model to classify penguin species based on physical features.
- Visualization of the Perceptron's decision boundary and error metrics.

## Visualization
The notebook includes visualizations such as:
- Error reduction over epochs during the training process.
- Decision boundary plot demonstrating the Perceptron's classification capability.
