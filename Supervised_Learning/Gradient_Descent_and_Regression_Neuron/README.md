# Gradient Descent 

Radient Descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize a function by iteratively moving towards the minimum value of the function. It is commonly used in machine learning to find the best parameters for a model. The algorithm updates the parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient of the objective function with respect to the parameters. In this file, I will build the Gradient Descent algorithm from scratch and implement it on a simple function.

# Regression Neuron
Linear regression can be conceptualized as the simplest form of a neural networkâ€”a single neuron model. This interpretation provides a foundational understanding of neural networks and is a bridge between traditional statistical methods and modern machine learning.
In this file, I will construct a Single Neuron Linear Regression Model from scratch. This model will then be applied to the Salary dataset.
