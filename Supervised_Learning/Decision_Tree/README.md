# Decision and Regression Trees 

## Overview
This Jupyter notebook provides a detailed exploration of decision and Regression Trees in machine learning. Utilizing two distinct datasets, the notebook demonstrates the implementation, evaluation, and visualization of decision trees using Python's Scikit-learn library.

## Datasets
1. **Palmer Penguins Dataset**:
   - Source: Kaggle, originally collected by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER.
   - Features: 'culmen_length_mm', 'culmen_depth_mm'
   - Target: 'Sex' of the penguin (Male/Female)
   - Task: Classification

2. **California Housing Dataset**:
   - Source: Scikit-learn's `fetch_california_housing` function
   - Features: Median Income, Housing Median Age, Average Rooms, Average Bedrooms, Population, Average Occupancy, Latitude, Longitude
   - Target: Median house value
   - Task: Regression
